		<Line id = "2" image = "KA2" audio = "KAIN2" text = "Well… “love” is a complicated word, but who am I to judge. Next question." />
		<Line id = "3" image = "KA3" audio = "KAIN3" text = "A game? Who said anything about a game? This is a job interview!" />
		<Line id = "4" image = "KA2" audio = "KAIN4" text = "Well I would, but I’m working, and I suggest you start taking this seriously as well. Next Question." />
		<Line id = "5" image = "KA1" audio = "KAIN5" text = "It says here you are an expert in funny words. Care to demonstrate?" />

		<Line id = "8" image = "KA4" audio = "KAIN8" text = "Don’t worry. According to your resume, you are an expert, and resumes never lie!" />
		<Line id = "9" image = "KA1" audio = "KAIN9" text = "Moving on, I need you to tell me one good thing about yourself, and one absolutely horrendous thing about yourself." />
